##Rules

At the beginning of the game the player and the dealer receive two cards from the deck. 
One of the dealers cards is facedown. 
Both players cards are face up. 
The player can choose to hit or hold during their turn. 
If the player hits, they receive another card. 
If they hold, the game ends. 
The goal of the game is to get the value of the cards as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
If the player goes over 21, they bust (lose). 
Face cards count for 10 points, aces can count for either 11 or 1 points, and all other cards count for their displayed value.
The dealer will continue to hit until the displayed cards value 17 or more.
If the dealer busts, the player wins automatically.
If neither player busts, the dealer's hidden card is revealed and the player with the highest value cards wins.
If the dealer and player have the same value cards at the end of the turn, the dealer wins.
